\section{Introduction}

The report, entitled "Netflix Challenge: Movie Rating Prediction", is prepared as my Challenge report for the course CSE2525-Data Mining at the Technische Universiteit Delft.
The purpose of this report is to develop a recommendation system for predicting movie ratings.
The goal of the recommendation system is to achieve Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as small as possible on an unseen dataset.

   \begin{tablenotes}
     \item In users - `gender', `0' and `1' indicates female users and male users, respectively;
     \item In movies - `year', only non-zero entries are considered.
   \end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

Three datasets are provided for training, as described in \Cref{tab:table-1}.
There is a total of 910,190 ratings, which were given by 6,040 users and 3,706 movies.
The rest `predictions.csv' file is used for final testing, which contains only `userID` and `movieID'.
