TODO
1. RMSE of old and new dataframes (submissions.csv)


''' 
# First observations
1. anormaly data
    - such as age=1 user, may need to treat it differently
2. gender
    - how to encode gender into number?
3. recall from lec that latest movies have higher ratings
    - also recall that item-item CF is more reliable than user-user CF
4. if each user rated each movie, then we should have 6040 * 3706 = 22384240 ratings
    - we only have 910190 ratings
    - very sparse

# Ideas
1. CF+Latent Model
    - different users have different standards, need to normalize star ratings
2. Dealing with missing entries
3. Dealing with anomaly entries
4. process movie names
    - such as use TFIDF
    - maybe add a important-word-score in the ratings-df
5. Dealing with cold-start problem
    - for existing user, use content-based approach
6. Try different N, find albow one?
7. write own RSME evaluation

# ???
    #   2. negative sim score
