\item Explain the problem that you are solving 
\item Summarize your main contributions to solving the problem.
\end{itemize}


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}
Describe the algorithms you used to solve the problem.
\subsection{Algorithm 1}
You could use subsections to describe different algorithms and/or improvements to them.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}
Describe your results. 
Include figures and quantitative facts proving that you method works (or not).
If you include figures or/and tables, always refer to them in the text, see table ~\ref{tab:table_example} and figure \ref{fig:figure_example}.
Make sure your figures are of good quality, have axis, ticks, labels, axis names and title. Also, the caption of the figure/table should contain sufficient information about the figure/table.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
\hline
heading1 &  heading 2  \\
\hline
value1,1 & value 2,1\\
value1,2 & value 2,2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{This is an example of a table.} 
\label{tab:table_example}
\end{table}
